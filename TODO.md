### **Technical Implementation Details - Bulk Edit Enhancement**

1. **Advanced Programming Techniques Applied**:
   - **Design by Contract**: Complete function contracts with preconditions, postconditions, and runtime verification
   - **Defensive Programming**: Multi-layer validation, resource limits (1000 files, 50 edits), and error isolation
   - **Type-Driven Development**: Enhanced Zod schemas with custom refinements and comprehensive type safety
   - **Immutability Principles**: Pure functions, Set-based deduplication, and functional composition patterns
   - **Property-Based Testing**: Postcondition verification and deterministic behavior validation

2. **Context-Based Matching Innovation**:
